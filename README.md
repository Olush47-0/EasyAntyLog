🔒 EasyAntyLog – Custom PvP Combat Logger Plugin for Paper/Spigot 1.20–1.21+
AntyLogout is a fully custom-built plugin designed for PvP, Survival, and Faction servers. Its main goal is to prevent players from escaping combat unfairly, whether by teleporting, logging out, or abusing mechanics to avoid dying. It’s lightweight, fast, and fully compatible with the latest PaperMC versions.

⚔️ Key Features:
✅ Combat Tag System
When a player attacks or is attacked, they are marked as "in combat" for 15 seconds. During this time:

❌ They cannot teleport (/spawn, /home, /tpa, /tpaccept, /casino, etc.)

❌ Logging out instantly kills them

✅ They can still place and break blocks, move around, and play normally

⏳ A bossbar appears on-screen showing a countdown until combat ends

🏹 Full Damage Detection:
The plugin tracks not only melee hits but also ranged and special attacks:

Bow 🎯

Crossbow 🏹

Trident 🧜

Custom weapons like a mace or warhammer 🔨

Wind Charge 🌪️ (e.g. from Elytra gliding)

All of these trigger combat mode and apply restrictions as intended.

🧠 Smart Behavior:
Upon death, the combat tag and bossbar are removed immediately

If a player logs out during combat, they die instantly and it’s logged in console

Once the 15 seconds pass without further combat, all restrictions are lifted

🧩 Lightweight, Fast, and Expandable:
Built purely on Bukkit/Paper API for performance and compatibility. No unnecessary dependencies. The plugin is easy to extend and customize for your server’s needs.
